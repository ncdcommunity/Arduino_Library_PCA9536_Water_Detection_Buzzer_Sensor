# PCA9536_WDBZ

This Water Sensor is designed to detect water or liquid leakage.  Convenient I2C interface makes it easy to add water leakage detection to any IoT application in seconds.  Integrated on-board Buzzer can be used for alarm notification applications. This Water detect Sensor uses a PCA9536 digital IO to detect the water and to control the buzzer.
